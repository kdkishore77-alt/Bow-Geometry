# Bow-Geometry
Simulation code for a geometry-first null model comparing the mechanical performance of three archaeological bow archetypes (self-bow, composite recurve, and asymmetric Yumi). Implements a reduced-order limb model with shared elastic and string parameters and archetype-specific geometry inputs.
